Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation &apos;s new export opportunity ? At any rate , the pop-eyed , rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has had his licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his signalling more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemagoing territories .

T-ori-73	Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country &apos;s name The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to &quot; Republic of North Macedonia , &quot; a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which had blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO . Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , maintains that its northern neighbor &apos;s name represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entrance into NATO and the EU . The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia &apos;s Slavic majority population . President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not be voting in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubts on whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid . The question on the referendum ballot read : &quot; Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece . &quot;

It is said to have reached staggering € 3.1billion ( $ 3.6bn ) - up from initial € 2.2 billion . Problems gripping the newest frigates become especially of importance in light of recent warnings that Germany &apos;s naval power is shrinking . Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , chief of the German parliament &apos;s defense committee , acknowledged the Navy is actually &quot; running out of deployment-capable ships . &quot; The official said the issue has snowballed over time , because old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided .

T-ori-302	How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening , and while the battle is far from over , a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term , experts say . Donald Trump , the US President , fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels , steel and aluminium . The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $ 200 billion ( £ 150 billion ) worth of items , effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China . Beijing has retaliated each time in kind , most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $ 60 billion of American goods . China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot , and the world &apos;s second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon . Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands , but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping , China &apos;s president .

T-ori-201	Brexit : UK &apos; would forever regret &apos; losing carmakers The UK &quot; would regret it forever &quot; if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit , Business Secretary Greg Clark has said .

The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs . The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota &apos;s Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union . &quot; My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory , &quot; said Marvin Cooke , Toyota &apos;s managing director at Burnaston .

T-ori-260	Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations Nigel Farage vowed to &apos; mobilise the people &apos;s army &apos; today during a protest at the Tory conference . The former Ukip leader said politicians had to &apos; feel the heat &apos; from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May &apos;s own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU . Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK &apos; would have been out &apos; by now if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary . But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city . The premier is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers , Remainers and the EU . Allies insisted she will push ahead with trying to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and &apos; chaos &apos; .

T-ori-236	Outside money floods into tightest midterm election House races It &apos;s not surprising that Pennsylvania &apos;s 17th is seeing a flood of cash , thanks to a realignment of a congressional districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat . This recently redrawn suburban Pittsburg district pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring . Lamb is running against another incumbent , Republican Keith Rothfus , who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district , which overlaps heavily with the new 17th . The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in Republicans &apos; favor . The race in the new 17th has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms , the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee ( DCCC ) and the National Republican Campaign Committee ( NRCC ) .

T-ori-4	&quot; The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white , &quot; he said , &quot; and therefore will hasten the day that these churches close altogether because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches . &quot; Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870 , St. Martin &apos;s a decade later . The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s . A black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took title to the building . St. Martin &apos;s was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev.

And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador , Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington .

T-ori-202	Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover . BMW , for example , says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit . The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit . Toyota &apos;s production line is run on a &quot; just-in-time &quot; basis , with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order . If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March , there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts . It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day &apos;s worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant , the company said , and so production would be stopped . Mr Clark said Theresa May &apos;s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is &quot; precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border . &quot;

T-ori-195	This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species . Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century . They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat . Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk , as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials , as well as attacks by pet cats . Bats are not actually blind . However , due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey . They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path . The NTS , which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes bats very seriously . It has ten trained experts , who regularly carry out surveys , roost inspections and sometimes rescues .

With upwards of 30,000 pupils across Scotland , these schools , represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , strive to deliver the best level of service to their pupils and parents . Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education , their chosen career and their place as global citizens . As an education sector that can design and implement a bespoke school curriculum , we are seeing modern languages continue as a popular and desired subject of choice within schools .

T-ori-94	North Korea says nuclear disarmament won &apos;t come unless it can trust US North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can &apos;t trust Washington . Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly . He called on the United States to follow through on promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rivals &apos; leaders . His comments come as US . Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea &apos;s Kim Jong Un . Ri says it &apos;s a &quot; pipe dream &quot; that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees . Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first making significant disarmament moves . Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit . But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its safety .

T-ori-305	Europe clinches Ryder Cup victory in Paris Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris , France . The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993 . Europe regained the crown as the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn &apos;s team reached the 14.5 points they required to beat the United States . US star Phil Mickelson , who struggled most of the tournament , plunked his tee-shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole , conceding his match to Francesco Molinari . The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all of his rounds , becoming 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament &apos;s current format begun in 1979 .

T-ori-107	Ryder Cup 2018 : Team USA show stomach for fight to keep hopes alive heading into Sunday singles After three one-sided sessions , Saturday afternoon &apos;s foursomes might just have been what this Ryder Cup needed . The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players truly believe in , and never more so than at competitions like these . So where would they say the momentum is now ? &quot; They had a six-point lead and now it &apos;s four , so we are carrying that as a little bit of momentum I guess , &quot; said Jordan Spieth as he strolled off for the day . Europe have the advantage , of course , four points ahead with twelve more in play . The Americans , as Spieth says , feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they have plenty to be encouraged by , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four . Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example .

T-ori-240	Study History The next shoe to drop could be the special counsel Robert Mueller &apos;s report on Mr. Trump &apos;s possible obstruction of justice , of which there now is very substantial evidence in the public record . Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump &apos;s campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections . Should Congress change hands , Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body , just as he prepares to go again before the voters , and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers . That is a lot of ifs , and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump &apos;s fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe . There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how prolonged the struggle may be . In 1938 , German officers were ready to stage a coup d &quot; état against Hitler , if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks at Munich . We failed , and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that ensued .

T-ori-204	Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again , says White House Donald Trump &apos;s high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be &quot; pushed back another week &quot; as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues , the White House said on Sunday . Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller , who is investigating Russian election interference , links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president . Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general , and thereby endanger Mueller &apos;s independence , has fuelled Washington gossip for months . Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment . Rosenstein denied the report . But last Monday he went to the White House , amid reports he was about to resign . Instead , a meeting with Trump , who was then at the United Nations in New York , was announced for Thursday .

T-ori-228	So we are continuing to pursue those individuals , &quot; Mr. Albence said . Seeking to process the children more quickly , officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained , rather than after 60 days , which was the previous standard , according to shelter workers . Many will appear via video conference call , rather than in person , to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge . Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported . The longer that children remain in custody , the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed , which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts , according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months . Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo , where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked , because of its size . They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with .

A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain &apos;s super-secret web network of spies , revealing the identities of all Britain &apos;s agents in the field , to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon .

The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey . Police cited security reasons to block a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque , but plenty of supporters turned out nearby to see their president . Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard , condemning both Erdogan &apos;s policies and the German government &apos;s decision to welcome him to the country .

But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson &apos;s try , converted by Baggot , reduced the leeway to five points . There was then a lengthy hold-up for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott , who was stretchered off , and from the restart , Ayr surged further ahead through a Stafford McDowall try , converted by Climo .

The culture of pride in &apos; pulling an all-nighter &apos; still exists , he said , adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem . Ensuring you have enough sleep , of a good quality , should be a student &apos;s &apos; secret weapon &apos; to combat stress , exhaustion and anxiety , he said - even to avoid putting on weight , as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode , making them constantly hungry . Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course , having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard . He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course . The next step , he hopes , it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution .

T-ori-216	Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday , survey finds The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain &apos;s struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains . Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent , figures revealed . Peter Martin , of business consultancy CGA , which compiled the figures , said : &quot; Continued sunshine and England &apos;s longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June , when pubs were up 2.8 per cent , except that restaurants were hit even harder . The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July . Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down . Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun , although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators . It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink .

T-ori-25	Parliament &apos;s statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by &apos; rewriting history &apos; row Its banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England &apos;s cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers .

The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell .

More than 820,000 people are affected in the country , health officials say . About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone . The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex , marking a change from the past . Traditionally , HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions . But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero , Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province . Year-on-year , however , the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people . HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China &apos;s LGBT community . Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997 , but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife . Because of the country &apos;s conservative values , studies have estimated that 70-90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women .

The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows . The Elvie Pump however , is completely silent , has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra , giving women the freedom to move , hold their babies , and even go out while pumping .

A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palu , but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity . President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia &apos;s tattered infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign , and he has lavished money on roads and railways .

Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia , where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith . More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands dislocated from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battled on the streets , using machetes , bows and arrows , and other crude weapons .

T-ori-119	The course , rolled out for the first time this year , explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance , as well as improve their general wellbeing . Paul Barreira , professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university &apos;s health services , said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students were seriously sleep deprived during the week . The hour long course involves a series of interactive tasks . In one section there is an image of a dorm room , where students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is impacted by sleep deficiency , and the importance of a bedtime routine . In another section , participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks , stroke , depression and cancer . A map of the campus , with interactive icons , then encourages participants to think about their daily routine . &apos;We know it won &apos;t change students &apos; behaviour instantly .

T-ori-92	Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on big screens across the country , hopeful that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia &apos;s claim that - after decades of fitful talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea . Evo Morales , Bolivia &apos;s charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has plenty riding on Monday &apos;s ruling . &quot; We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean , &quot; he vowed in late August . But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia &apos;s favour - and that little would change if it did . The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory , and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks . That the ICJ &apos;s ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates the case &quot; wasn &apos;t complicated , &quot; said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert in international law . And far from furthering Bolivia &apos;s cause , the past four years may have set it back .

T-ori-10	The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers . In addition , perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury &apos;s stores , the first of which opened in Croydon , south London , last week while a second opens in Selly Oak , Birmingham , later this year . Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit . Mike Coupe , the chief executive of Sainsbury &apos;s , has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food . Sainsbury &apos;s has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable .

T-ori-211	The surcharge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty , including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-lets - could be as much as three per cent . The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £ 120 million a year . An estimated 13 per cent of new-build London properties are bought by non-UK residents , driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder . Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become &quot; ghost towns &quot; because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country . The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people own their first home . He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by snapping up land but not using it , and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain &apos;s &quot; housing disgrace . &quot; Mr Corbyn has announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms , including rent controls and an end to &quot; no-fault &quot; evictions .

T-ori-267	Russian Grand Prix : Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over Sebastian Vettel It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes &quot; team orders would play a large part in the race . From pole , Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate . Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack , something which should have been decisive . The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel , but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner . Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday .

T-ori-84	It has become increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership . This started shortly after Jeremy became leader , as colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market . Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn &apos;t really matter what I say - there follows a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection , denouncing the politics of the centre , telling me I should not be in the Labour party . And that is not just my experience . Indeed , I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political . I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away . One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalised . Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance .

T-ori-42	According to Catalan authorities almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote going ahead at polling stations across the region in violent clashes . Pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police . The demonstration went ahead but was forced to take a different route . Narcis Termes , 68 , an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence . &quot; Last year we lived through one of our best moments . I watched my parents cry with joy at being able to vote but now we are stuck , &quot; he said . Despite managing a vital if narrow victory in regional elections last December , Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to retain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders either in self imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence . Joan Puig , a 42-year-old mechanic recording the protest in support of the police on his phone , said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides .

T-ori-85	The reality is we are no longer that broad church and with every &quot; no-confidence &quot; motion or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower . I have had lots of advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down , not to be so vocal and then I would &quot; be all right . &quot; But that is not what I came into politics to do . Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil , provoked by the Thatcher government &apos;s neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down , I &apos;ve sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister . I have never hidden my politics , including at the last election . No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership . To those who promoted the motion on Friday , all I would say is that when the country is ploughing towards a Brexit that will hurt households , businesses and our public services , I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader .

T-ori-100	From this year &apos;s recent exam results , we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rates within independent schools . A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher grade A . The data , collected from SCIS &apos;s 74 member schools , showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin , while 72 per cent of those studying German , 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an A . This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future . Languages now , as a subject choice , are being held in the same regard as STEM subjects ( science , technology , engineering and mathematics ) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere . A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies , 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage . Therefore more and more , language skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers . With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages , these skills are essential in a globalised world .

T-ori-227	Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged , in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors . Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves , and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child . The risk increased in June , when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints , and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities . Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement , testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors . The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records . &quot; Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally , and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens .

T-ori-293	North Korea defector numbers &apos; drop &apos; under Kim The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago , a South Korean lawmaker has said . Park Byeong-seug , citing data from the South &apos;s unification ministry , said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011 . Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors . Pyongyang has made no public comments . The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship . Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953 . Most flee via China , which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone ( DMZ ) between the two Koreas . China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them . Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months .

T-ori-192	Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports . However , continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service , Die Zeit notes . The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year , when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg . This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery . Little was known about the reasons behind the return , but German media cited a number of crucial &quot; software and hardware defects &quot; that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission . Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates . Also , it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy &apos;s ability to add future upgrades .

T-ori-207	Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland over Brexit fears The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland &apos;s NHS to express the country &apos;s gratitude and wish for them to stay on post-Brexit . Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK withdraws from the EU . The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services . In her letter , Ms Freeman wrote : &quot; Over the summer , negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal have continued , heading towards expected decisions this autumn . But the UK Government has also been stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario . I know this must be a very unsettling time for all of you . That is why I wanted to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of every member of staff , regardless of their nationality . Colleagues from across the EU , and beyond , bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service , and benefit the patients and communities we serve . Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here . &quot;

Heavy rain will spread into the Four Corners on Tuesday and last through Wednesday . October can see some intense temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler , but the tropics remain quite warm . Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances . There is a great example of dramatic temperature differences through the central U.S. on Sunday . There is nearly a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City , Missouri , and Omaha , Nebraska , and between St. Louis and Des Moines , Iowa . Over the next few days , lingering summer warmth will try to build and expand again . Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October with widespread 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast . New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday , which would be approximately 10 degrees above average .

T-ori-41	Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police , and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia &apos;s polarizing vote on secession . A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police pelted them with eggs and hurled powder paint , creating dark clouds of dust in streets that would usually be thronged with tourists . Scuffles also broke out later in the day with police using their batons to contain the fighting . Over several hours pro-independence groups chanting &quot; No forgetting , no forgiveness &quot; faced off with unionist protesters shouting , &quot; Long live Spain . &quot; Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests , local press reported . Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans . Voters chose overwhelmingly to become independent , though turnout was low with those against secession largely boycotting the vote .

T-ori-122	Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers : Menga goal downs Gerrard &apos;s men Rangers suffered another bout of away-day blues as Dolly Menga &apos;s strike consigned Steven Gerrard &apos;s disjointed side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston . The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February &apos;s 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone , but Gary Holt &apos;s team inflicted just Gerrard &apos;s second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adrift of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts . Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling . While Rangers now drop down to sixth spot , Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference . And there could be further trouble in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end . Gerrard made eight changes to the side which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals .

T-ori-194	National Trust eavesdrops on secret life of bats New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food . It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities . The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross . Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season . NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors . Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what . A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour . Rob Dewar , nature conservation adviser for NTS , hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species .
