T-ori-2	Macedonians go to polls in referendum on changing country &apos;s name Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country &apos;s name to the &quot; Republic of North Macedonia . &quot; The popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece , which has its own province called Macedonia . Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor &apos;s name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids for the EU and NATO . Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change , has said he will disregard the vote . However , supporters of the referendum , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO .

T-ori-73	Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country &apos;s name The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to &quot; Republic of North Macedonia , &quot; a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which had blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO . Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , maintains that its northern neighbor &apos;s name represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entrance into NATO and the EU .

American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low . &quot; That &apos;s an extremely good thing , &quot; said Jaynes . Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane . He said the flight attendants were panicking and yelling , and that he suffered a minor head injury . The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving a wharf also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to shuttle people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters ( 100 feet ) of water . Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini .

T-ori-11	The supermarket &apos;s previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure . Sainsbury &apos;s tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s , but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist &apos;s stores in its supermarkets . The new strategy comes after Sainsbury &apos;s sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio , the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain , for £ 125m , three years ago . It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan , by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores .

T-ori-302	How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening , and while the battle is far from over , a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term , experts say . Donald Trump , the US President , fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels , steel and aluminium . The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $ 200 billion ( £ 150 billion ) worth of items , effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China . Beijing has retaliated each time in kind , most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $ 60 billion of American goods . China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot , and the world &apos;s second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon . Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands , but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping , China &apos;s president .

Lamb is running against another incumbent , Republican Keith Rothfus , who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district , which overlaps heavily with the new 17th .

T-ori-195	This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species . Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century . They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat . Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk , as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials , as well as attacks by pet cats . Bats are not actually blind . However , due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey . They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path . The NTS , which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes bats very seriously . It has ten trained experts , who regularly carry out surveys , roost inspections and sometimes rescues .

T-ori-99	John Edward : Languages skills essential for global citizens Scotland &apos;s independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence , and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results , which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports , art , music and other community endeavours . With upwards of 30,000 pupils across Scotland , these schools , represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , strive to deliver the best level of service to their pupils and parents . Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education , their chosen career and their place as global citizens . As an education sector that can design and implement a bespoke school curriculum , we are seeing modern languages continue as a popular and desired subject of choice within schools . Nelson Mandela said : &quot; If you talk to a man in a language he understands , that goes to his head . If you talk to him in his own language that goes to his heart . &quot; This is a powerful reminder that we can &apos;t just rely on English when wanting to build relationships and trust with people from other countries .

H-99	-0.955432116985321	England striker Ben Davies made only 12 overs , adding a third to miss a game as their match ended , and also his fourth in eight outings during a match in which England , who were only nine out after the half-hour international break , ended up fighting for this one . Fairfax Media understands Rashford , playing four minutes in time , thinks there is every bit of pressure hanging from the locker room to string his stuff together with a lot of praise for Paul Pogba he wanted to stay with , and would be an ideal replacement with all of the way to Europe in 2018 . We all know there &apos;s a decent player and certainly a qualifier against Samuel Umtiti who gets to play as a team and dives into two positions to score , and also because you have to say they are always going to have a good team playing well enough to give them time to work . * If he wants to stick with his team it &apos;s nothing to worry too . * * This is a big year that we can &apos;t just rely on Paul Ringrose or Robbie Deans for this period .

So where would they say the momentum is now ? &quot; They had a six-point lead and now it &apos;s four , so we are carrying that as a little bit of momentum I guess , &quot; said Jordan Spieth as he strolled off for the day . Europe have the advantage , of course , four points ahead with twelve more in play . The Americans , as Spieth says , feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they have plenty to be encouraged by , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four . Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example .

Should Congress change hands , Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body , just as he prepares to go again before the voters , and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers .

The hosts were content to let Rangers play in front of them , knowing they could trouble the visitors at set pieces . And that was the manner in which the crucial goal came . Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston worked an opening , Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining to set up Menga , who took a touch and scored from the centre of the box . By that stage , Rangers had dominated possession but had found the home defence impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely untroubled , That pattern continued into the second half , though Alfredo Morelos did force a save from Kelly . Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow flicked wide from another Livingston set play .

Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller , who is investigating Russian election interference , links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president . Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general , and thereby endanger Mueller &apos;s independence , has fuelled Washington gossip for months . Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment . Rosenstein denied the report . But last Monday he went to the White House , amid reports he was about to resign . Instead , a meeting with Trump , who was then at the United Nations in New York , was announced for Thursday .

Seeking to process the children more quickly , officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained , rather than after 60 days , which was the previous standard , according to shelter workers . Many will appear via video conference call , rather than in person , to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge . Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported . The longer that children remain in custody , the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed , which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts , according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months . Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo , where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked , because of its size . They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with .

It &apos;s the last day of President Erdogan &apos;s controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing relations beteen the NATO allies . They &apos;ve fallen out over issues including human rights , press freedom and Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU . Erdogan then headed for Cologne to open a giant new mosque . The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey . Police cited security reasons to block a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque , but plenty of supporters turned out nearby to see their president . Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard , condemning both Erdogan &apos;s policies and the German government &apos;s decision to welcome him to the country . The dueling protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as an autocrat by others .

Ensuring you have enough sleep , of a good quality , should be a student &apos;s &apos; secret weapon &apos; to combat stress , exhaustion and anxiety , he said - even to avoid putting on weight , as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode , making them constantly hungry . Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course , having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard .

T-ori-216	Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday , survey finds The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain &apos;s struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains . Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent , figures revealed . Peter Martin , of business consultancy CGA , which compiled the figures , said : &quot; Continued sunshine and England &apos;s longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June , when pubs were up 2.8 per cent , except that restaurants were hit even harder . The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July . Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down . Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun , although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators . It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink .

T-ori-138	HIV / Aids : China reports 14 % surge in new cases China has announced a 14 % jump in the number of its citizens who are living with HIV and Aids . More than 820,000 people are affected in the country , health officials say . About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone . The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex , marking a change from the past . Traditionally , HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions . But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero , Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province . Year-on-year , however , the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people . HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China &apos;s LGBT community . Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997 , but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife .

In 1987 , when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and bowed out of the race , Ms. Schroeder , deeply frustrated , figured there was no reason she shouldn &apos;t explore the idea of running for president herself . &quot; It was not a well-thought-out decision , &quot; she said to me with a laugh 30 years later .

T-ori-10	The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers . In addition , perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury &apos;s stores , the first of which opened in Croydon , south London , last week while a second opens in Selly Oak , Birmingham , later this year . Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit . Mike Coupe , the chief executive of Sainsbury &apos;s , has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food . Sainsbury &apos;s has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable .

T-ori-211	The surcharge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty , including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-lets - could be as much as three per cent . The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £ 120 million a year . An estimated 13 per cent of new-build London properties are bought by non-UK residents , driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder . Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become &quot; ghost towns &quot; because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country . The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people own their first home . He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by snapping up land but not using it , and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain &apos;s &quot; housing disgrace . &quot; Mr Corbyn has announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms , including rent controls and an end to &quot; no-fault &quot; evictions .

T-ori-267	Russian Grand Prix : Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over Sebastian Vettel It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes &quot; team orders would play a large part in the race . From pole , Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate . Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack , something which should have been decisive . The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel , but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner . Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday .

The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama , where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans but only just got over the finishing line with their noses in front by the narrowest of margins , winning 14 ½ -13 ½ . &quot; You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama ; we had a big lead at Brookline , where we lost , and at Valderrama , where we won , but only just , &quot; said Bjorn , pictured , after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National .

This started shortly after Jeremy became leader , as colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market . Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn &apos;t really matter what I say - there follows a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection , denouncing the politics of the centre , telling me I should not be in the Labour party . And that is not just my experience . Indeed , I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political . I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away . One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalised . Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance .

In an interview airing Sunday , &quot; 60 Minutes &quot; correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could unearth anything that would lead them to change their minds .

Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil , provoked by the Thatcher government &apos;s neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down , I &apos;ve sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister .

No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership . To those who promoted the motion on Friday , all I would say is that when the country is ploughing towards a Brexit that will hurt households , businesses and our public services , I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader .

A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher grade A . The data , collected from SCIS &apos;s 74 member schools , showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin , while 72 per cent of those studying German , 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an A . This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future . Languages now , as a subject choice , are being held in the same regard as STEM subjects ( science , technology , engineering and mathematics ) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere . A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies , 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage . Therefore more and more , language skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers . With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages , these skills are essential in a globalised world .

T-ori-227	Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged , in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors . Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves , and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child . The risk increased in June , when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints , and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities . Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement , testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors . The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records . &quot; Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally , and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens .

T-ori-293	North Korea defector numbers &apos; drop &apos; under Kim The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago , a South Korean lawmaker has said . Park Byeong-seug , citing data from the South &apos;s unification ministry , said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011 . Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors . Pyongyang has made no public comments . The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship . Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953 . Most flee via China , which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone ( DMZ ) between the two Koreas . China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them . Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months .

T-ori-192	Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports . However , continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service , Die Zeit notes . The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year , when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg . This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery . Little was known about the reasons behind the return , but German media cited a number of crucial &quot; software and hardware defects &quot; that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission . Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates . Also , it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy &apos;s ability to add future upgrades .

T-ori-41	Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police , and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia &apos;s polarizing vote on secession . A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police pelted them with eggs and hurled powder paint , creating dark clouds of dust in streets that would usually be thronged with tourists . Scuffles also broke out later in the day with police using their batons to contain the fighting . Over several hours pro-independence groups chanting &quot; No forgetting , no forgiveness &quot; faced off with unionist protesters shouting , &quot; Long live Spain . &quot; Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests , local press reported . Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans . Voters chose overwhelmingly to become independent , though turnout was low with those against secession largely boycotting the vote .

T-ori-122	Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers : Menga goal downs Gerrard &apos;s men Rangers suffered another bout of away-day blues as Dolly Menga &apos;s strike consigned Steven Gerrard &apos;s disjointed side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston . The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February &apos;s 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone , but Gary Holt &apos;s team inflicted just Gerrard &apos;s second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adrift of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts . Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling . While Rangers now drop down to sixth spot , Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference . And there could be further trouble in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end . Gerrard made eight changes to the side which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals .

T-ori-194	National Trust eavesdrops on secret life of bats New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food . It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities . The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross . Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season . NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors . Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what . A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour . Rob Dewar , nature conservation adviser for NTS , hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species .
