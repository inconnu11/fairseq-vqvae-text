Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change , has said he will disregard the vote .

T-ori-184	Out-of-form Mickelson benched on Ryder Cup Saturday American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match , but he will have to turn his form around to avoid it being an unhappy milestone . Mickelson , playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time , was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday &apos;s fourballs and foursomes . Instead of being at the center of the action , as he so often has been for the United States , the five-times major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the range in the hope of rectifying what ails him . Never the straightest of drivers even at the peak of his career , the 48-year-old is not an ideal fit for the tight Le Golf National course , where the long rough routinely punishes errant shots .

T-ori-153	But just how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal ? Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand a call for action , or just another case of so-called &quot; clicktivism &quot; - people feeling like they are making a true difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet ? Since 2011 , Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million &quot; actions &quot; from its supporters , pushing for a host of different goals . It says that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equating to more than $ 37 billion that is set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030 . In early 2018 , the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions , at least $ 10 billion of which have already been disbursed or fundraised . The group estimates the secured funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the world .

T-ori-73	Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country &apos;s name The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to &quot; Republic of North Macedonia , &quot; a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which had blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO . Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , maintains that its northern neighbor &apos;s name represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entrance into NATO and the EU . The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia &apos;s Slavic majority population . President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not be voting in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubts on whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid . The question on the referendum ballot read : &quot; Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece . &quot;

T-ori-193	The 7,000-ton &quot; Rheinland-Pfalz &quot; is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War . Aside from faulty hardware , the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also becoming an issue . It is said to have reached staggering € 3.1billion ( $ 3.6bn ) - up from initial € 2.2 billion . Problems gripping the newest frigates become especially of importance in light of recent warnings that Germany &apos;s naval power is shrinking . Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , chief of the German parliament &apos;s defense committee , acknowledged the Navy is actually &quot; running out of deployment-capable ships . &quot; The official said the issue has snowballed over time , because old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided . He lamented that none of the of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy .

T-ori-11	The supermarket &apos;s previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure . Sainsbury &apos;s tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s , but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist &apos;s stores in its supermarkets . The new strategy comes after Sainsbury &apos;s sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio , the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain , for £ 125m , three years ago . It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan , by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores . Paul Mills-Hicks , Sainsbury &apos;s commercial director , said : &quot; We &apos;ve transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers .

T-ori-302	How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening , and while the battle is far from over , a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term , experts say . Donald Trump , the US President , fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels , steel and aluminium . The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $ 200 billion ( £ 150 billion ) worth of items , effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China . Beijing has retaliated each time in kind , most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $ 60 billion of American goods . China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot , and the world &apos;s second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon . Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands , but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping , China &apos;s president .

T-ori-201	Brexit : UK &apos; would forever regret &apos; losing carmakers The UK &quot; would regret it forever &quot; if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit , Business Secretary Greg Clark has said .

The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs . The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota &apos;s Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union . &quot; My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory , &quot; said Marvin Cooke , Toyota &apos;s managing director at Burnaston .

The animal who killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin . A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking anyone else , while police gathered evidence at the scene . Yuan &apos;s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death . Though rare , cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before . In 2016 , a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts , leaving the man with critical injuries .

T-ori-236	Outside money floods into tightest midterm election House races It &apos;s not surprising that Pennsylvania &apos;s 17th is seeing a flood of cash , thanks to a realignment of a congressional districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat .

Lamb is running against another incumbent , Republican Keith Rothfus , who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district , which overlaps heavily with the new 17th . The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in Republicans &apos; favor . The race in the new 17th has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms , the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee ( DCCC ) and the National Republican Campaign Committee ( NRCC ) .

Vice President Mike Pence is now slated to address the conference , now scheduled for mid-October , in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering , the diplomats said . And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador , Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington . A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials , including two diplomats , who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity . Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity .

T-ori-202	Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover . BMW , for example , says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit . The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit . Toyota &apos;s production line is run on a &quot; just-in-time &quot; basis , with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order . If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March , there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts . It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day &apos;s worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant , the company said , and so production would be stopped . Mr Clark said Theresa May &apos;s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is &quot; precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border . &quot;

T-ori-18	Indonesia Tsunami and Quake Devastate an Island , Killing Hundreds In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake , for instance , foreign nongovernmental organizations were told they were not needed . Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok &apos;s population had been dislocated , no national disaster was declared , a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid . &quot; In many cases , unfortunately , they &apos;ve been very clear that they &apos;re not requesting international assistance , so it &apos;s a bit challenging , &quot; Ms. Sumbung said . While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu , it is not yet sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground . Mr. Sutopo , the national disaster agency spokesman , said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort . Given the earth shaking that Indonesia constantly endures , the country remains woefully underprepared for nature &apos;s wrath . While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh , they are not a common sight on other coastlines .

T-ori-195	This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species . Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century . They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat . Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk , as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials , as well as attacks by pet cats . Bats are not actually blind . However , due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey . They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path . The NTS , which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes bats very seriously . It has ten trained experts , who regularly carry out surveys , roost inspections and sometimes rescues .

With upwards of 30,000 pupils across Scotland , these schools , represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , strive to deliver the best level of service to their pupils and parents . Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education , their chosen career and their place as global citizens . As an education sector that can design and implement a bespoke school curriculum , we are seeing modern languages continue as a popular and desired subject of choice within schools .

His comments come as US . Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea &apos;s Kim Jong Un . Ri says it &apos;s a &quot; pipe dream &quot; that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees . Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first making significant disarmament moves . Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit .

T-ori-305	Europe clinches Ryder Cup victory in Paris Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris , France . The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993 . Europe regained the crown as the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn &apos;s team reached the 14.5 points they required to beat the United States . US star Phil Mickelson , who struggled most of the tournament , plunked his tee-shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole , conceding his match to Francesco Molinari . The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all of his rounds , becoming 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament &apos;s current format begun in 1979 . American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5 &amp; 4 by the lowest-ranked player on the European team , Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark .

UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks . The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province , where three million people live . Moualem however stressed that the agreement had &quot; clear deadlines &quot; and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front , who &quot; will be eradicated . &quot;

T-ori-240	Study History The next shoe to drop could be the special counsel Robert Mueller &apos;s report on Mr. Trump &apos;s possible obstruction of justice , of which there now is very substantial evidence in the public record . Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump &apos;s campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections . Should Congress change hands , Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body , just as he prepares to go again before the voters , and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers . That is a lot of ifs , and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump &apos;s fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe . There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how prolonged the struggle may be . In 1938 , German officers were ready to stage a coup d &quot; état against Hitler , if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks at Munich . We failed , and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that ensued .

T-ori-204	Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again , says White House Donald Trump &apos;s high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be &quot; pushed back another week &quot; as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues , the White House said on Sunday . Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller , who is investigating Russian election interference , links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president . Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general , and thereby endanger Mueller &apos;s independence , has fuelled Washington gossip for months . Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment . Rosenstein denied the report . But last Monday he went to the White House , amid reports he was about to resign . Instead , a meeting with Trump , who was then at the United Nations in New York , was announced for Thursday .

T-ori-228	So we are continuing to pursue those individuals , &quot; Mr. Albence said . Seeking to process the children more quickly , officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained , rather than after 60 days , which was the previous standard , according to shelter workers . Many will appear via video conference call , rather than in person , to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge . Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported . The longer that children remain in custody , the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed , which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts , according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months . Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo , where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked , because of its size . They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with .

T-ori-83	Labour is no longer a broad church . It is intolerant of those who speak their minds When Momentum &apos;s activists in my local party voted to censure me , it was hardly a surprise . After all , I &apos;m the latest in a line of Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome - all for speaking our minds . My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely stood up to antisemitism . In my case , the censure motion criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn . On the importance of a responsible economic policy , on national security , on Europe , ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders . The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that &quot; we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive . &quot; For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP , the Friday night GC meetings have been exactly that . Sadly today , it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of &quot; kinder , gentler &quot; politics has long been forgotten if , indeed , it ever began .

Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher slotted the ball to Scott Robinson , who kept his cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish . Gerrard acted at the break as he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the winger slotted in Morelos but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block . But Livingston continued to suck the visitors into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy , with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long ball after long ball .

It &apos;s the last day of President Erdogan &apos;s controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing relations beteen the NATO allies . They &apos;ve fallen out over issues including human rights , press freedom and Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU . Erdogan then headed for Cologne to open a giant new mosque . The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey . Police cited security reasons to block a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque , but plenty of supporters turned out nearby to see their president . Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard , condemning both Erdogan &apos;s policies and the German government &apos;s decision to welcome him to the country . The dueling protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as an autocrat by others .

But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson &apos;s try , converted by Baggot , reduced the leeway to five points . There was then a lengthy hold-up for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott , who was stretchered off , and from the restart , Ayr surged further ahead through a Stafford McDowall try , converted by Climo . Ayr acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded , and again , Melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine try , at the end of a spell of fierce pressure . The home side came back , however , and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow-carded for tackling Climo without the ball , from the penalty line-out , MacPherson touched down at the back of the advancing Ayr maul .

Why didn &apos;t Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate ? Their reluctance is all due to timing . The midterm elections are only five weeks away , on November 6 - if , as expected , the Republicans do badly , then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land .

T-ori-120	But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes , &apos; Prof Czeisler added . The culture of pride in &apos; pulling an all-nighter &apos; still exists , he said , adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem . Ensuring you have enough sleep , of a good quality , should be a student &apos;s &apos; secret weapon &apos; to combat stress , exhaustion and anxiety , he said - even to avoid putting on weight , as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode , making them constantly hungry . Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course , having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard . He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course . The next step , he hopes , it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution .

T-ori-216	Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday , survey finds The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain &apos;s struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains . Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent , figures revealed . Peter Martin , of business consultancy CGA , which compiled the figures , said : &quot; Continued sunshine and England &apos;s longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June , when pubs were up 2.8 per cent , except that restaurants were hit even harder . The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July . Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down . Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun , although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators . It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink .

T-ori-25	Parliament &apos;s statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by &apos; rewriting history &apos; row Its banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England &apos;s cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers . But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick &apos;s suggestion as &quot; folly &quot; and &quot; attempting to rewrite history . &quot; John Goldsmith , chairman of the Cromwell Society , said : &quot; It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target . The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell . Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century . Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft &apos;s magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who many believe is still worth celebrating .

T-ori-138	HIV / Aids : China reports 14 % surge in new cases China has announced a 14 % jump in the number of its citizens who are living with HIV and Aids . More than 820,000 people are affected in the country , health officials say . About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone . The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex , marking a change from the past . Traditionally , HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions . But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero , Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province . Year-on-year , however , the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people . HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China &apos;s LGBT community . Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997 , but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife . Because of the country &apos;s conservative values , studies have estimated that 70-90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women .

T-ori-299	One of my sharpest memories from an early job , in a male-dominated office , where I once found myself weeping with inexpressible rage , was my being grabbed by the scruff of my neck by an older woman - a chilly manager of whom I &apos;d always been slightly terrified - who dragged me into a stairwell . &quot; Never let them see you crying , &quot; she told me . &quot; They don &apos;t know you &apos;re furious . They think you &apos;re sad and will be pleased because they got to you . &quot; Patricia Schroeder , then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado , had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential runs . In 1987 , when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and bowed out of the race , Ms. Schroeder , deeply frustrated , figured there was no reason she shouldn &apos;t explore the idea of running for president herself . &quot; It was not a well-thought-out decision , &quot; she said to me with a laugh 30 years later .

T-ori-93	&quot; The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration , &quot; said Zárate . Morales &apos;s belligerent rhetoric has sapped any residual Chilean goodwill , she suggested . Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk , but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this . The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962 . Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé , Bolivia &apos;s representative at The Hague , rejected the idea that the court &apos;s decision-making was unusually speedy . Monday will bring Bolivia &quot; an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile &quot; and a chance to &quot; put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits , &quot; he said . Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America &apos;s most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch . &quot; Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean , &quot; he added . &quot; The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past . &quot;

T-ori-19	The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu , even though a warning had been in effect , is likely to have contributed to the loss of life . At the best of times , traveling between Indonesia &apos;s many islands is challenging . Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated . A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palu , but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity . President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia &apos;s tattered infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign , and he has lavished money on roads and railways . But funding shortfalls have plagued Mr. Joko &apos;s administration as he faces re-election next year . Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia , where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith . More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands dislocated from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battled on the streets , using machetes , bows and arrows , and other crude weapons .

Evo Morales , Bolivia &apos;s charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has plenty riding on Monday &apos;s ruling . &quot; We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean , &quot; he vowed in late August . But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia &apos;s favour - and that little would change if it did .

And far from furthering Bolivia &apos;s cause , the past four years may have set it back .

T-ori-10	The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers . In addition , perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury &apos;s stores , the first of which opened in Croydon , south London , last week while a second opens in Selly Oak , Birmingham , later this year . Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit . Mike Coupe , the chief executive of Sainsbury &apos;s , has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food . Sainsbury &apos;s has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable .

T-ori-211	The surcharge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty , including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-lets - could be as much as three per cent . The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £ 120 million a year . An estimated 13 per cent of new-build London properties are bought by non-UK residents , driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder . Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become &quot; ghost towns &quot; because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country . The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people own their first home . He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by snapping up land but not using it , and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain &apos;s &quot; housing disgrace . &quot; Mr Corbyn has announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms , including rent controls and an end to &quot; no-fault &quot; evictions .

T-ori-267	Russian Grand Prix : Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over Sebastian Vettel It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes &quot; team orders would play a large part in the race . From pole , Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate . Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack , something which should have been decisive . The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel , but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner . Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday .

T-ori-165	Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors For survivors , the situation was increasingly dire . &quot; It feels very tense , &quot; said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma , comforting her feverish baby boy at an evacuation centre in the gutted city of Palu . &quot; Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies . Clean water is scarce . &quot; Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes , picking through waterlogged belongings , trying to salvage anything they could find . Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals , damaged by the magnitude 7.5 quake , were overwhelmed . Some of the injured , including Dwi Haris , who suffered a broken back and shoulder , rested outside Palu &apos;s Army Hospital , where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuing strong aftershocks . Tears filled his eyes as he recounted feeling the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter . &quot; There was no time to save ourselves .

A mainstay of science ever since , the Geiger Counter became a pop culture mainstay as well , as in the 1950 movie &quot; Bells of Coronado , &quot; starring those seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans : Man : &quot; What in the world is that ? &quot; Rogers : &quot; It &apos;s a Geiger Counter , used to locate radioactive minerals , such as uranium . When you put these earphones on , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given off by the radioactivity in the minerals . &quot; Evans : &quot; Say , it sure is popping now ! &quot;

T-ori-148	Labour denies it is devising a plan for Britons to work a four day week but be paid for five days Jeremy Corbyn &apos;s Labour Party is to consider a radical plan which will see Britons working a four day week - but getting paid for five .

It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same pay . Sources said the idea would &apos; fit &apos; with the party &apos;s economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers . Shifting to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy .

T-ori-84	It has become increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership . This started shortly after Jeremy became leader , as colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market . Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn &apos;t really matter what I say - there follows a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection , denouncing the politics of the centre , telling me I should not be in the Labour party . And that is not just my experience . Indeed , I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political . I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away . One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalised . Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance .

T-ori-167	U.S. ambassador accuses China of &apos; bullying &apos; with &apos; propaganda ads&apos; A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade , the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda . U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily &apos;s paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa &apos;s biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections , a charge China denies . Trump &apos;s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China . While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other &apos;s imports . China &apos;s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump &apos;s Republican Party , Chinese and U.S. experts have said .

The ball eventually dropped over a leaping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net . &quot; It was just trying to get into that position , to get on the ball and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible , so I just tried to create myself as much time as possible , &quot; Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com . &quot; I saw Kante coming and took one touch and didn &apos;t think about it too much and just took the shot on . &quot;

T-ori-85	The reality is we are no longer that broad church and with every &quot; no-confidence &quot; motion or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower . I have had lots of advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down , not to be so vocal and then I would &quot; be all right . &quot; But that is not what I came into politics to do . Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil , provoked by the Thatcher government &apos;s neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down , I &apos;ve sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister . I have never hidden my politics , including at the last election . No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership . To those who promoted the motion on Friday , all I would say is that when the country is ploughing towards a Brexit that will hurt households , businesses and our public services , I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader .

T-ori-100	From this year &apos;s recent exam results , we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rates within independent schools . A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher grade A . The data , collected from SCIS &apos;s 74 member schools , showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin , while 72 per cent of those studying German , 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an A . This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future . Languages now , as a subject choice , are being held in the same regard as STEM subjects ( science , technology , engineering and mathematics ) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere . A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies , 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage . Therefore more and more , language skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers . With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages , these skills are essential in a globalised world .

According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013 , 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage , 15 per cent .

Having multiple languages , particularly those of developing economies , will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment . Within Scotland , each school will differ in the languages they teach . A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages , whereas others will teach languages that are deemed to be most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese .

T-ori-227	Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged , in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors . Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves , and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child . The risk increased in June , when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints , and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities . Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement , testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors . The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records . &quot; Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally , and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens .

T-ori-293	North Korea defector numbers &apos; drop &apos; under Kim The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago , a South Korean lawmaker has said . Park Byeong-seug , citing data from the South &apos;s unification ministry , said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011 . Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors . Pyongyang has made no public comments . The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship . Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953 . Most flee via China , which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone ( DMZ ) between the two Koreas . China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them . Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months .

T-ori-192	Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports . However , continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service , Die Zeit notes . The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year , when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg . This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery . Little was known about the reasons behind the return , but German media cited a number of crucial &quot; software and hardware defects &quot; that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission . Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates . Also , it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy &apos;s ability to add future upgrades .

T-ori-41	Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police , and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia &apos;s polarizing vote on secession . A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police pelted them with eggs and hurled powder paint , creating dark clouds of dust in streets that would usually be thronged with tourists . Scuffles also broke out later in the day with police using their batons to contain the fighting . Over several hours pro-independence groups chanting &quot; No forgetting , no forgiveness &quot; faced off with unionist protesters shouting , &quot; Long live Spain . &quot; Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests , local press reported . Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans . Voters chose overwhelmingly to become independent , though turnout was low with those against secession largely boycotting the vote .

T-ori-122	Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers : Menga goal downs Gerrard &apos;s men Rangers suffered another bout of away-day blues as Dolly Menga &apos;s strike consigned Steven Gerrard &apos;s disjointed side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston . The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February &apos;s 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone , but Gary Holt &apos;s team inflicted just Gerrard &apos;s second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adrift of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts . Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling . While Rangers now drop down to sixth spot , Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference . And there could be further trouble in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end . Gerrard made eight changes to the side which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals .

T-ori-194	National Trust eavesdrops on secret life of bats New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food . It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities . The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross . Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season . NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors . Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what . A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour . Rob Dewar , nature conservation adviser for NTS , hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species .
