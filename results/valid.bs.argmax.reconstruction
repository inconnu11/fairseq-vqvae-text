T-ori-113	Three-times major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday . They earned a gritty 2 &amp; 1 win over Spain &apos;s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 &amp; 3 in the foursomes having lost the opening two holes . Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit going into the singles , although as holders Furyk &apos;s side need only draw to retain the trophy .

T-ori-2	Macedonians go to polls in referendum on changing country &apos;s name Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country &apos;s name to the &quot; Republic of North Macedonia . &quot; The popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece , which has its own province called Macedonia . Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor &apos;s name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids for the EU and NATO . Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change , has said he will disregard the vote . However , supporters of the referendum , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO .

T-ori-73	Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country &apos;s name The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to &quot; Republic of North Macedonia , &quot; a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which had blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO .

T-ori-278	The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon short of the runway . Some witnesses thought the plane overshot the runway . American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low . &quot; That &apos;s an extremely good thing , &quot; said Jaynes . Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane . He said the flight attendants were panicking and yelling , and that he suffered a minor head injury . The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving a wharf also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to shuttle people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters ( 100 feet ) of water . Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini .

T-ori-11	The supermarket &apos;s previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure . Sainsbury &apos;s tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s , but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist &apos;s stores in its supermarkets .

Donald Trump , the US President , fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels , steel and aluminium . The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $ 200 billion ( £ 150 billion ) worth of items , effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China . Beijing has retaliated each time in kind , most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $ 60 billion of American goods . China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot , and the world &apos;s second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon . Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands , but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping , China &apos;s president .

T-ori-195	This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species . Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century . They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat . Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk , as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials , as well as attacks by pet cats . Bats are not actually blind . However , due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey . They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path . The NTS , which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes bats very seriously . It has ten trained experts , who regularly carry out surveys , roost inspections and sometimes rescues .

T-ori-1	The Assembly Commission , which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes , said : &quot; The final decision on any descriptors of what Assembly Members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves . &quot; The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name . In June , the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which found broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament . On the matter of the AMs &apos; title , the Commission favoured Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs , but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation . AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options , but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the Presiding Officer , Elin Jones , who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within weeks . The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works , including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system . AMs will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation .

What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller &apos;s investigation ? Rosenstein has been in hot water ever since this paper reported that , last year , he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his being unfit for office . Mr. Rosenstein says The Times &apos;s account is inaccurate . &quot; How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not full or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony ?

The Americans , as Spieth says , feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they have plenty to be encouraged by , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four . Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is leading by example .

T-ori-204	Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again , says White House Donald Trump &apos;s high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be &quot; pushed back another week &quot; as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues , the White House said on Sunday . Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller , who is investigating Russian election interference , links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president . Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general , and thereby endanger Mueller &apos;s independence , has fuelled Washington gossip for months . Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment . Rosenstein denied the report . But last Monday he went to the White House , amid reports he was about to resign . Instead , a meeting with Trump , who was then at the United Nations in New York , was announced for Thursday .

Seeking to process the children more quickly , officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained , rather than after 60 days , which was the previous standard , according to shelter workers . Many will appear via video conference call , rather than in person , to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge . Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported . The longer that children remain in custody , the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed , which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts , according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months . Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo , where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked , because of its size . They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with .

T-ori-49	Erdogan get mixed reception in Cologne There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday ( September 29 ) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakast in Berlin . It &apos;s the last day of President Erdogan &apos;s controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing relations beteen the NATO allies . They &apos;ve fallen out over issues including human rights , press freedom and Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU . Erdogan then headed for Cologne to open a giant new mosque . The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey . Police cited security reasons to block a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque , but plenty of supporters turned out nearby to see their president . Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard , condemning both Erdogan &apos;s policies and the German government &apos;s decision to welcome him to the country . The dueling protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as an autocrat by others .

The culture of pride in &apos; pulling an all-nighter &apos; still exists , he said , adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem .

T-ori-216	Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday , survey finds The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain &apos;s struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains .

Peter Martin , of business consultancy CGA , which compiled the figures , said : &quot; Continued sunshine and England &apos;s longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June , when pubs were up 2.8 per cent , except that restaurants were hit even harder . The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July . Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down . Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun , although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators . It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink .

More than 820,000 people are affected in the country , health officials say . About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone . The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex , marking a change from the past . Traditionally , HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions . But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero , Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province . Year-on-year , however , the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people . HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China &apos;s LGBT community . Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997 , but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife . Because of the country &apos;s conservative values , studies have estimated that 70-90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women .

In addition , perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury &apos;s stores , the first of which opened in Croydon , south London , last week while a second opens in Selly Oak , Birmingham , later this year . Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit . Mike Coupe , the chief executive of Sainsbury &apos;s , has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food . Sainsbury &apos;s has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable .

T-ori-267	Russian Grand Prix : Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over Sebastian Vettel It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes &quot; team orders would play a large part in the race . From pole , Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate . Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack , something which should have been decisive . The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel , but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner . Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday .

The 24-year-old said he did not realise until he went to secondary school that &quot; not everyone is like me . &quot; Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne , he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others &quot; hope . &quot; He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics . The regular presenter of the long-running show , Kirsty Young , has taken a number of months off because of illness . Appearing as a castaway on Laverne &apos;s first programme , Daley said he felt &quot; less than &quot; everyone else growing up because &quot; it wasn &apos;t socially acceptable to like boys and girls . &quot; He said : &quot; To this day , those feelings of feeling less than , and feeling different , have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed . &quot;

T-ori-115	Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 , when Kim pledged to work toward &quot; denuclearization of the Korean peninsula &quot; while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea &apos;s security .

T-ori-42	According to Catalan authorities almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote going ahead at polling stations across the region in violent clashes . Pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police . The demonstration went ahead but was forced to take a different route . Narcis Termes , 68 , an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence . &quot; Last year we lived through one of our best moments . I watched my parents cry with joy at being able to vote but now we are stuck , &quot; he said .

The data , collected from SCIS &apos;s 74 member schools , showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin , while 72 per cent of those studying German , 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an A . This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future . Languages now , as a subject choice , are being held in the same regard as STEM subjects ( science , technology , engineering and mathematics ) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere . A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies , 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage . Therefore more and more , language skills are becoming imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers . With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages , these skills are essential in a globalised world .

Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition . According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013 , 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage , 15 per cent . This is why putting the investment into language teaching now is important for today &apos;s children . Having multiple languages , particularly those of developing economies , will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment . Within Scotland , each school will differ in the languages they teach . A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages , whereas others will teach languages that are deemed to be most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese . Whatever your child &apos;s interest , there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools , with teaching staff who are specialists in this area .

T-ori-227	Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged , in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors . Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves , and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child . The risk increased in June , when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints , and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities . Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement , testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors . The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records . &quot; Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally , and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens .

Park Byeong-seug , citing data from the South &apos;s unification ministry , said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011 . Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors . Pyongyang has made no public comments . The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship . Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953 . Most flee via China , which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone ( DMZ ) between the two Koreas . China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them . Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months .

However , continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service , Die Zeit notes . The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year , when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg . This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery . Little was known about the reasons behind the return , but German media cited a number of crucial &quot; software and hardware defects &quot; that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission . Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates . Also , it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy &apos;s ability to add future upgrades .

The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February &apos;s 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone , but Gary Holt &apos;s team inflicted just Gerrard &apos;s second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adrift of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts . Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling . While Rangers now drop down to sixth spot , Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference . And there could be further trouble in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end . Gerrard made eight changes to the side which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals .

T-ori-41	Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police , and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia &apos;s polarizing vote on secession . A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police pelted them with eggs and hurled powder paint , creating dark clouds of dust in streets that would usually be thronged with tourists . Scuffles also broke out later in the day with police using their batons to contain the fighting . Over several hours pro-independence groups chanting &quot; No forgetting , no forgiveness &quot; faced off with unionist protesters shouting , &quot; Long live Spain . &quot; Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests , local press reported . Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans . Voters chose overwhelmingly to become independent , though turnout was low with those against secession largely boycotting the vote .

T-ori-194	National Trust eavesdrops on secret life of bats New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food . It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities . The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross . Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season . NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors . Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what . A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour . Rob Dewar , nature conservation adviser for NTS , hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species .
